<Prompted question here>

### Response:

<Response from copilot here>

## Prompt #2
Do we need to update our Prisma schema to complete the task?

### Response:
- Yes, we need to ensure the Prisma schema includes the necessary relations and fields.
- Updated the schema for Application, Candidate, and Interview models.
- Provided commands to apply the changes.

---

## Prompt #3

Lets validate if our files [#file:schema.prisma-1](#file:schema.prisma-1-context) [#file:Application.ts](#file:Application.ts-context) [#file:Candidate.ts](#file:Candidate.ts-context) [#file:Interview.ts](#file:Interview.ts-context) are already prepared to implement this endpoint or if we need to modify them and update prisma

### Response:

- Validated the files and confirmed that they are already prepared to implement the endpoint.
- No modifications to the Prisma schema are needed.

---

## Prompt #4

As our prisma schema and models dont need any update lets proceed with the implementation of our endpoint

### Response:

- Confirmed that the Prisma schema and models do not need any updates.
- Proceeding with the implementation of the endpoint.

---

## Prompt #5

proceed?

### Response:

- Defined the route in `candidateRoutes.ts`.
- Created the controller function in `candidateController.ts`.
- Added a service function in `candidateService.ts`.

---

## Prompt #6

shouldnt #file:candidateService.ts instead of calling prisma directly use the Model #file:Candidate.ts instead?

### Response:

- Yes, it is a good practice to use the `Candidate` model instead of calling Prisma directly.
- Updated `candidateService.ts` to use the `Candidate` model.
- Added a new static method `findApplicationsByPositionId` to the `Candidate` model.

---

## Prompt #7

Shouldnt we instead of mapping the application instances, implement the findMany in our #file:Application.ts model?

### Response:

- Yes, it would be better to implement the `findMany` method in the `Application` model.
- Added the `findMany` method to the `Application` class in `Application.ts`.
- Updated `candidateService.ts` to use the `findMany` method from the `Application` model.

---

## Prompt #8

now lets fix the error shown in #file:Candidate.ts which states. (Do [#not forget file:pro](#not forget file:pro-context)mpts-RJD.md file update)
```
Type '({ candidate: { firstName: string; lastName: string; }; interviews: { score: number | null; }[]; } & { id: number; positionId: number; candidateId: number; applicationDate: Date; currentInterviewStep: number; notes: string | null; })[]' is not assignable to type 'Application[]'. Property 'save' is missing in type '{ candidate: { firstName: string; lastName: string; }; interviews: { score: number | null; }[]; } & { id: number; positionId: number; candidateId: number; applicationDate: Date; currentInterviewStep: number; notes: string | null; }' but required in type 'Application'.ts(2322) Application.ts(25, 11): 'save' is declared here.
```

### Response:

- Updated `findApplicationsByPositionId` method in `Candidate.ts` to map the results to instances of the `Application` class.

---

## Prompt #9

is our implementation done? how can we test it?

### Response:

- Confirmed that the implementation is complete.
- Provided steps to test the new endpoint:
  1. Write unit tests in `candidateRoutes.test.ts`.
  2. Run the tests using `npm test`.
  3. Manually test the endpoint using `curl` or Postman.

---

## Prompt #10

selected method is showing a compiler error, lets review step by step it is correctly implemented

### Response: 

- Ensure Application model includes necessary fields and relations.
- Ensure Candidate model includes necessary fields.

---

## Prompt #11

How can we test this endpoint? What data should be in our database to get a 200 response?

### Response:

- Provided steps to test the endpoint using `curl` and Postman.
- Listed the necessary data in the database to get a 200 response:
  - Positions
  - Candidates
  - Applications
  - Interviews

---

## Prompt #12

endpoint is not working, lets debug it

### Response:

- Added logging statements to `candidateController.ts` and `candidateService.ts` to trace the flow of data.
- Provided steps to run the endpoint and analyze the logs to identify the issue.

---

## Prompt #13

i think we need to add a positions route

### Response:

- Created `positionRoutes.ts` to handle the `/positions/:id/candidates` endpoint.
- Updated `index.ts` to use the new `positionRoutes`.

---

## Prompt #14

I do not think my route is being correctly configured. Im getting a 404 not found when executing the endpoint

### Response:

- Verified `positionRoutes.ts` is correctly set up.
- Verified `candidateController.ts` has the `getCandidatesByPosition` function.
- Verified `index.ts` correctly imports and uses `positionRoutes`.
- Restarted the server and tested the endpoint again.

---

## Prompt #15

still getting a 404 when executing my new endpoint

### Response:

- Verified `positionRoutes.ts` is correctly set up.
- Verified `candidateController.ts` has the `getCandidatesByPosition` function.
- Verified `index.ts` correctly imports and uses `positionRoutes`.
- Restarted the server and tested the endpoint again.

---

## Prompt #16

I have rebuilt the project with npm run build and restarted and my endpoint is now working. Lets proceed with a new requirement. The order we are taking on this task is identifying what are our components that will be affected to achieve this task.

PUT /candidates/:id/stage
Este endpoint actualizará la etapa del candidato movido. Permite modificar la fase actual del proceso de entrevista en la que se encuentra un candidato específico.

### Response:

- Identified affected components:
  1. Route definition in `candidateRoutes.ts`.
  2. Controller function in `candidateController.ts`.
  3. Service function in `candidateService.ts`.
  4. Model update in `Application.ts`.
- Provided step-by-step implementation for the new endpoint.

---

## Prompt #17

Im sorry lets try again I didnt provide the complete steps we taking to achieve this task.

the task:
PUT /candidates/:id/stage
Este endpoint actualizará la etapa del candidato movido. Permite modificar la fase actual del proceso de entrevista en la que se encuentra un candidato específico.

The steps
1. identifying all the files we need to work with
2. Identifying if we need to perform any models or prisma schema changes
3. Creating the routes
4. Implementing the code logic

Lets proceed with step 1 first

### Response:

- Identified all the files we need to work with:
  1. `backend/src/routes/candidateRoutes.ts`
  2. `backend/src/presentation/controllers/candidateController.ts`
  3. `backend/src/application/services/candidateService.ts`
  4. `backend/src/domain/models/Application.ts`
  5. `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (if necessary)

---

## Prompt #18

yes, lets proceed with step 2. Do we need to modify our models or schema prisma?

### Response:

- Reviewed the requirements for the `PUT /candidates/:id/stage` endpoint.
- Confirmed that the `Application` model already includes the `currentInterviewStep` field.
- No changes to the Prisma schema or models are needed.

---

## Prompt #19

Before that, does our #file:Application.ts has every method we need to work with?

### Response:

- Reviewed the methods in `Application.ts`.
- Added the `findByCandidateId` method to find an application by candidate ID.

---

## Prompt #20

Alright, lets proceed with the implementation starting with the routes, then the controller and lastly the service.

### Response:

- Updated `candidateRoutes.ts` to include the new route for updating the candidate stage.
- Added the `updateCandidateStage` function in `candidateController.ts`.
- Added the `updateCandidateStageById` function in `candidateService.ts`.

---

## Prompt #21

yes, lets test it

### Response:

- Provided steps to test the new endpoint:
  1. Write unit tests in `candidateRoutes.test.ts`.
  2. Run the tests using `npm test`.
  3. Manually test the endpoint using `curl` or Postman.

---

## Prompt #22

Im getting an error executing the endpoint

### Response:

- The error indicates a foreign key constraint violation on the `currentInterviewStep` field.
- Verified the `InterviewStep` model exists and has the necessary data.
- Ensured the `Application` model correctly references the `InterviewStep` model.
- Updated the `updateCandidateStageById` function to set a valid `InterviewStep` ID.
- Ensured the database is seeded with valid `InterviewStep` data.

---

## Prompt #23

lets stop and [#verify our file:App](#verify our file:App-context)lication.ts model

### Response:

- Verified the `Application.ts` model.
- Confirmed that it has all the necessary fields and methods for our implementation.

---

## Prompt #24

modify this creation of a company to create if it doesnt exist

### Response:

- Updated `seed.ts` to use the `upsert` method for creating a company if it doesn't exist.
