## Prompt #49

yes we have step 1, step 2 and step 3 configured correctly but the test is still logging the normal database, lets try and set it up differently

### Response:

- Explicitly set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in the test setup file before initializing Prisma.
- Verified the environment variables are loaded correctly.

---

## Prompt #50

now our error changed to `src/tests/setup.ts:1:10 - error TS2305: Module '"@prisma/client"' has no exported member 'PrismaClient'.`

### Response:

- Ensured the Prisma client is generated by running `npx prisma generate`.
- Checked the Prisma client version in `package.json` to ensure compatibility.
- Verified TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json` to recognize the Prisma client.
